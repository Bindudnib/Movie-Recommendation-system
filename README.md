This project aims to build a movie recommendation system using natural language processing techniques and cosine similarity. The recommendation system suggests movies to users based on their favorite movie by analyzing various features of the movies such as genre, keywords, tagline, cast, and director. The system uses the TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert text data into numerical format and cosine similarity to find the most similar movies.

The dataset used in this project is publicly available and contains information about various movies, including:

Movie_Title: The title of the movie
Movie_Genre: The genre of the movie
Movie_Keywords: Keywords associated with the movie
Movie_Tagline: The tagline of the movie
Movie_Cast: The main cast of the movie
Movie_Director: The director of the movie
